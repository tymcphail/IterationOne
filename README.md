# Project Life Cycle
This team-created document outlines the development of the Guide Book Pro project, a premium platform for bespoke fishing trips, from Iteration 1 to Iteration 5. Iteration 1 focused on establishing the foundation with requirements analysis, system architecture, and user interface mockups, prioritizing personalized trip booking and CRM integration. By Iteration 5, the project included refined class diagrams, normalized database design, advanced user interface prototypes, and project scheduling. This progression demonstrates the platform's evolution into a user-centric, sophisticated system tailored for high-end clients.
